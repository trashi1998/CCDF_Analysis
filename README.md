Analysis of Credit Card Fraud
I analyse this data set by using Naive Bayes and Random Forest Algorithms 
after comparing these two Algorithms 
<h3>Tuning hyperparameter of Random Forest- <h3>Since we know Random Forest provide more accuracy than Naïve Bayes Theorem so we need to optimization random forest  that it beats Naïve Bays in all sorts of things .
Since Naïve Bayes is faster than Random Forest so, we need to tune the hyperparameter  so that it speed up the algorithm.
