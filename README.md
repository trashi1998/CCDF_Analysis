# ABSTRACT
In Banking Sector lots of transactions happens in day but it doesn’t mean that all the transactions done
successfully, some transactions get hacked in between by using different types of hacking techniques. The
financial organisations are facing different challenges related to transactions and this type of fraud is one of
them as well as the main edginess lies detecting fraud as early as possible. Due to excessive advancement in
technology, it is essential for bank to save its money from fraud. The foremost motive of this project is to
represent technologies those can contribute to detect credit card fraud. These technologies will help to
determine the credit card fraud and provide the persuadable result. In this project we will use Random Forest,
Naïve Bayes, KNeighbour Algorithms, these are Machine Learning Algorithm for fraud detection. This paper
highlights key statistics and visualisation techniques. The project is implemented in python.
Keywords: credit card fraud, Types of frauds, Random Forest, decision tree, Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression
# - INTRODUCTION
## 1.1 PURPOSE
When we talk about technology the more the advancement in technology, the more the frauds. The
main target is the money and so is the credit card frauds. The attackers repeatedly try to attack on the
various numerous transactions and people are annoyed by the confirmation messages they receive
when they didn’t even transact. Credit Card Fraud is one of the biggest issues faced by the
government and the amount of money involved in this is generally enormous. Companies are pretty
vigilance in terms of detecting all these anomalies in fraud detection because they don’t want their
customers suffer any illegal transactions that are happening just because somebody else can get away
with it.


As in the growing world , the credit cards are widely used in various financial related work. But as in
growing technology the card less transactions or online transactions are usually performed in online
payment gateways. It has made the transactions much simpler , easier and requiring less effort. But as
everything has a demerit, the online transactions that are making comfort for the people are basically
under the eye of the attackers and thus making fraud transactions. This basically causes a huge loss of
data. It is nothing but an online theft. As the online transactions are increasing day by day and so is
the fraud on these transactions. As in these transactions, only the card information is adequate for a
fraud. Credit card fraud is a major topic from the past few years and should be resolved using a proper
fraud detection model


Credit card fraud happens when consumers give their card number to the unknown or unfamiliar
individuals. Credit cards are widely used because of mobile intelligent devices. Transaction fraud has
developed a fence in the growth of commerce and has a big theatrical stimulus on the budget. That’s
why fraud detection is necessary.

#### There are two types of methods used for card detection to monitor the transaction behaviour of a cardholder: anomaly detection and misuse detection.
Anomaly detection method shapes the profile of all the businesses and misuse detection generally
uses the various classifier techniques. Anomaly detection requires a huge dataset which have a huge
amount of cases that detects the anomaly among them.
For opting such technique, one has to know allabout the knowledge of the frauds to construct models
and patterns off fraud.This problem is very relevant to demand the attention of communities such as
machine learning and data science where the solution can be automated.

Particularly, the problem is challenging from the perspective of learning, as it is characterised by
various factors such as class imbalance and the transaction patterns often change their statistical
properties over the course of time.
Machine Learning algorithms are employed for analysing all the authorized transactions and report
the fraudulent ones, Professionals investigated these reports who contact the cardholder to confirm
that transaction was genuine or fraudulent. The feedback is provided by the investigators to the
automated system which is used to train and update the algorithm to improve the fraud detection
performance over time.

### In this project we use some method and Random Forest Algorithm to train the genuine and scam
behaviour characteristics. It is a classification algorithm based on the major probability of all base classifier. Its basically as supervised machine algorithm. Our main aim is towards training this algorithm over a classification based problem. Our project includes few technical steps –
1) Preparation of data
2) Training of the model
3) Evaluation
4) Optimization
5) Deployment

All supervised learning algorithm however require a data set and that data have to be partitioned for
the training purpose and for final evaluation of our project. Here we had divided in a 60-40 ratio , the
60% of data we had used for training the algorithm and remaining 40 % for the final evaluation of the
model. We need to ensure that both the cases i.e. fraud and normal transactions need to be present in
the data set .
Furthermore, calculating precision,recall,F1 score and accuracy and intervention. In this project, will
also explore the use of data visualisation techniques such as correlation matrices , and a heatmap, pie
chart etc.
### Some of the used approaches to detection of such fraud are:
- Bayesian Networks
- Logistic Regression.
- Decision Tree
So, our purpose is that by using classifiers of Machine Learning Algorithm and Data Science
techniques, the companies can identify illegal transactions much faster than the existing system, so that.
## 1.2 OBJECTIVE
The main objective is building a model that can be simply used for capturing the untrue
transactions. We will include supervised learning algorithms that could easily distinguish
between the transactions and could make a comparison on accuracy over the results generated.

## 1.3DEFINITION AND OVERVIEW
Generally,Credit card fraud detection is the technique that basically distinguish the transactions. In this
project, we had used an efficient machine learning algorithm. The patterns of the transactions basically
differ than the genuine transactions. This differs the transactions on general note. It suspects the
enormous transactions that are left unseen. The technique must provide accuracy at its peak and should
will in differentiating the transactions among the fraud and the genuine by learning the dissimilarity
among them it is the main requirement of the financial organisation.
This technique could ensure the results with a proper historical credit card dataset containing millions
of transactions easily resembling every type of transaction with proper details. It could be something
challenging to suspect different patterns among ton of transactions.





Machine Learning has generally two types of techniques: Supervised Technique and Unsupervised
Technique. Supervised Learning methods analyse generally the labelled data and unsupervised
learning algorithm analyses the unlabelled data. The most favoured supervised learning algorithms
may include the random forests algorithm, decision trees, KNN etc. Thus for fraud detection
technique to achieve the highest transformations and detection an effective supervised learning
algorithm is chosen.
The main contribution of f the projectis clarified as:
1)The use of Bayesian Theorem and the Random Forest Algorithm to mainly train and test the
genuine or fraud transactions and to resemble the their features.
2)Performing the experiment over a ton of transactions and analysing the integration of
the algorithms.
3)Concluding the experiment and framing some additive information.

## 1.4 AIM OF THE PROJECT
#### To comprehend the dataset and make the dataset proper with the goal that it very well may be feed to the machine and expectations can be made.
#### To do near investigation by applying different Al calculations, for example, KNN, random forest,decision tree, naive Bayes etc.and so on.
Find out the best calculation among all.their customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase.
